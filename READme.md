# Digital Dice Kit 🎲

This project is a complete digital dice set featuring all the polyhedral dice required to play Dungeons & Dragons and other Tabletop Role-Playing Games, accessible wherever you are.

## Getting Started

- Follow these steps to clone and run the application locally:

  - `git clone git@github.com:IndieMasco/Digital-Dice-Kit.git`
  - `cd Digital-Dice-Kit`
  - In the terminal, navigate to the client folder and run `npm install`
  - To start the application, use `npm run dev`

OR

- Access the live version hosted on Render for immediate use: https://digital-dice-kit.onrender.com

## Usage

- The Digital Dice Kit is designed for intuitive and quick use, supporting a wide range of rolls:

  - **Select a Die**: Scroll to the die you wish to roll.
  - **Set Roll Quantity**: Use the "Number of rolls" input field to specify how many dice you want to roll. The default is 1 roll.
  - **Execute Roll**: Click the "Roll Dice" button.
  - **View Rolls**: The application instantly displays the value of every individual die rolled as "Rolls", which you can use to identify critical rolls, while the total is calculated automatically.

## Features

- **Complete Set**: Includes all standard D&D dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100.
- **Multiple Rolls**: Supports rolling any quantity of a specific die type.
- **Clear Results**: Each result is clearly displayed beneath the corresponding die type.
- **Automatic Totaling**: The sum of all individual rolls is instantly calculated and displayed.
- **Live Deployment**: Easily accessible via the provided Render link.

## Framework and Languages Used

- **Framework**: React
- **Languages**: JavaScript, CSS, HTML5

## Lessons Learned

This project has been a highly rewarding experience in personal development, demonstrating significant progress since its inception in Week Two of the course.

- The project began as a basic D20 tool implemented with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The decision to completely rebuild it from scratch in React was pivotal, providing the necessary scalability and robust state management to easily integrate the full set of polyhedral dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100.

- When implementing the dice functionality in React, I initially started by giving each of the seven dice types its own separate component. I quickly identified this was inefficient. After researching best practices, I refactored the code to manage all seven dice types within a single component. This significantly reduced code redundancy and improved the maintainability of the application.
