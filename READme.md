# Digital Dice Kit

Originally, this project was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and functioned only as a D20. I have now completely rebuilt it from scratch in React to include all the standard dice required for a game of Dungeons & Dragons: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100.

It's been quite a rewarding journey seeing this project progress through its different stages: from HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to now being a React application. When I first started making this project in Week Two, it was very basic.

When I began implementing it in React, I was initially giving each dice its own component. I soon realized there must be an easier way to get this done with less code, so I went down a couple of "rabbit holes" to find the information i needed to get it done. Now, all the dice are managed within a single component with minimal code.
